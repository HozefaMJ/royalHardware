Chipboard screws of different lengths can be used in a variety of applications. They are created to fasten low, medium and high density chipboard. Many chipboard screws are self-tapping, so there is no need to drill holes in advance."

These screws almost always have a Phillips Bulge Head rather than a slotted head, which provides additional control for installers. In addition of a standard drill, installers also use a tool known as a drywall dimpler, which has an adjustable nose to install a drywall screw without tearing the paper on each sheet."

      "job": "ASME standards specify a variety of 'Machine Screws' in diameters ranging up to 0.75 in (19.05 mm). These fasteners are often used with nuts but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts). They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction. In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts."

      "job": "Similar to sheet metal screws, but they have a drill-shaped point to cut through sheet metal or steel which eliminates the need for drilling a pilot hole. These self-drilling screws are designed for use in soft steel or other metals.Self-drilling screw points are numbered from 1 through 5, the larger the number, the thicker metal it can go through without a pilot hole. A 5 point can drill a 0.5 in (13 mm) of steel, for example."
